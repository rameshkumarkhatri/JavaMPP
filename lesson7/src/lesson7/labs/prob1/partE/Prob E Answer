Interface A has <<abstract>> method()
B extend A
C extend A

class D implements B, C {

    @Override
    public void method() {

    }

}

class D extends B, C {

}

1. If D is class then D will overrides the method otherwise it will throw compile time error. Class has high priority and this method implementation will work.
2. If D is interface then it also has to override the method and we can call the super method of interface B or C
